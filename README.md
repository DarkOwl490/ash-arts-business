# Ash Arts
## Ash Arts Company Portfolio
As part of a codecademy project, I was assigned to make a page utilizing flexbox layout to make a company webpage, real or made up. I got my brother's permission to use his content for this project to build a company portfolio. (Not an existing company, just what my brother wanted to call it)

## Technology Used
VS Code: html & css

## Resources
- Got the canvas texture splash image from unsplash.com
- Brother and I decided on a color palette by using coolors.co
- Art itself is my brother's original work, credits to Matthew H. (@Matthew--HWH deviantart)
- Photo of Matthew taken by myself
